I didn't bother with the description. This will be done later, I swear.

**Lab 1.**

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset/download

GloVe: https://github.com/allenai/spv2/blob/master/model/glove.6B.100d.txt.gz

Extract the prerequisites into the same folder as the notebook. 

Install the requirements by calling
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

It contains lots of redundant packages, it's sufficient to install tensorflow-gpu, seaborn, numpy, sklearn, nltk, keras, pandas.

**Lab 2.**
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus#ner_dataset.csv

Follow the instructions above, except that the updated requirements are named as `requirements_2.txt`.
